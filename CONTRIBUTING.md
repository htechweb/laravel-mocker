## Important Notes

- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP Code Sniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer).

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure to update the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) for the changelogs and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for the application versioning

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

**Happy coding**!
